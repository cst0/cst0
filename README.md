### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name's Chris Thierauf, and I write code for robots. Most of it deals with ROS in some way. A handful of those projects are pretty mature, and you may find them useful.

gpio_control is a platform-agnostic GPIO control library and ROS interface.

discretized_movement allows for complex movement tasks to be simplified by turning them into a discrete grid space, making it useful for machine learning applications by simplifying the state/action space.

## Contact
Outside of GitHub, I write code for the HRI Lab at Tufts University as a PhD student there. If you're interested in academic collaboration, feel free to email/message me.
